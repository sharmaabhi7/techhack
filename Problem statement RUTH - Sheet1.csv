RUTH253,Smart and Effective realtime Management of street parking,"ln lndia, the number of vehicles is constanfly on the rise, while the availability of parking space in cities has not kept pace with the increasing vehicle numbers, primarily due to the rapid groMh in population. Consequenfly, issues such as traffic congestion, narrowed streets due to on-street parking, a mismatch between parking supply and demand, and illegal parking have become all too familiar in lndian cities. Parking space has become a scarce commodity, and instead of simply increasing the number of available parking spaces, it is crucial to employ effective technology-based solutions to optimize their utilization. Smart parking solutions, utilizing sensors and software, can provade realtime information on available parking spaces to both city officials and drivers. Furthermore, leveraging emerging technologies can help optimize parking prices. A low parking price may encourage more vehicles on the road, leading to increased air and noise pollution, whereas too high prices may generate less revenue and less efectuve resource usage.Apart from the loss of revenue for operators, there is economic downside to the business in vicinity, effect on government taxes, employment.At the same parking space area and costs also have a corelation to balance optimum usage and revenue. Therefore, setting the right price for parking based on demand and optimizing occupancy is the best approach. The primary objective of the solution should be to equip city administrators with an effective parking management tool that can predict, manage, and finance parking in cities. An app should be developed to allow citizens to conveniently reserve pce king spots and make payments based on dynamic pricing This not only saves citizens' time spent searching the parking but also reduces environmental degradation resulting from congestion caused by parking and provides a sustainable source of revenue for the city administration. We need an innovative, simple and widely coveraged parking needs in the city and also become most compliant for Traffic and mobility needs.",

RUTH257,Design a game-based tool to aware kids about the law related to their rights.,"Children are often unaware of their legal rights, such as the right to education, protection from exploitation, freedom of expression, and protection against abuse or discrimination. Traditional methods of teaching laws and rights (such as lectures, textbooks, or awareness campaigns) fail to capture the attention of kids due to their complexity and lack of engagement. This gap in awareness makes children vulnerable to violations of their rights, as they do not recognize when their rights are being denied or violated.To address this challenge, there is a need to design an interactive, game-based learning tool that simplifies legal concepts and presents them in a child-friendly way. Through engaging gameplay, stories, challenges, and rewards, kids can learn about their rights in a fun, memorable, and impactful manner. The tool should include elements like role-playing, quizzes, puzzles, and real-life scenarios where children make decisions that demonstrate their understanding of laws and rights.",

RUTH260,"Capacity building, performance assessment and motivation driven tool for faculty upgradation","If teachers were given more freedom, as would likely happen if a blended learning model were introduced as mentioned above, innovation would rocket, and an education system overhaul isn't exactly necessary to accomplish that. After all, there are (and will always be) plenty of options open to teachers to introduce more creativity and innovation to their lessons. Some of the options include Learning Management System (LMS), which allows teachers to create their own personalized, interactive courses from content provided by a range of publishers. Students can then access these courses on any device, while the app keeps a record of how they are progressing. If students are struggling. the course can quickly be altered. If students struggle with boredom, game-based learning can be introduced with LMS. Although granting teachers access to tablets and smartboards may help boost their comfort with education technology, many teachers simply have not thought about how they can best utilize technology in their curriculum. Indeed, the way a history teacher utilizes laptops in the classroom may be very different than the way a math teacher utilizes a smartboard. Both likely require plenty of time for trial, error, and experimentation to bring their lesson plans up to date. A major challenge in the adoption of new tools is not providing teachers with the guidance they need to make education technology work for them in their specific classroom. To overcome the challenge, it is necessary to have ERP solution for the teachers with adequate credit mechanism which can used for appraisals and performance-based incentives to the teachers.",

RUTH289,Similar Document Template Matching Algorithm,"In our organization, we encounter a significant challenge when dealing with a large volume of medical invoices, prescriptions, and lab test reports received from numerous providers, including doctors, hospitals, and labs, as well as from customers. To streamline our processes and improve efficiency, we aim to develop a system capable of extracting and standardizing these documents at a provider level. Additionally, we need to identify claims across different providers that exhibit similar document templates. The primary issue we face stems from fraudulent customers who exploit identical digital or printed templates, with minor modifications such as changing the provider names, logos, colors, and text content positioning. By manipulating the customer details within these templates, they attempt to file reimbursement claims that are difficult to detect using standard document comparison checks. To tackle this problem, we require the development of a robust Similar Document Template Matching Algorithm. This algorithm will automate the process of template extraction and standardization, allowing us to identify similarities and patterns across various documents. By comparing the templates used in different claims, we can effectively identify instances of potential fraud, even when the textual content has been altered. The algorithm should be designed to handle a high volume of documents from diverse providers and customers. It should be capable of identifying commonalities in template structure, design elements, and formatting, while also accounting for variations resulting from legitimate differences between providers. Key objectives of the Similar Document Template Matching Algorithm: 1. Template Extraction: Develop a mechanism to extract and standardize templates from medical invoices, prescriptions, and lab test reports received from providers and customers. 2. Template Comparison: Implement an algorithm to compare and identify similarities among different document templates, accounting for minor modifications and variations in content. 3. Fraud Detection: Enhance the algorithm to flag instances of potentially fraudulent claims where similar templates are used, with modifications made to customer details while maintaining the overall structure and design. 4. Scalability and Efficiency: Ensure the algorithm can handle a large volume of documents efficiently, considering the growing number of providers and customers we deal with. 5. Flexibility: Design the algorithm to accommodate variations in template design and content across different providers, while maintaining the ability to detect fraudulent patterns The successful development and implementation of the Similar Document Template Matching Algorithm will significantly enhance our ability to detect fraudulent claims and improve the overall accuracy and efficiency of our document processing workflows. Theme: Fraud Detection & Document Templatization Evaluation Criteria: The effectiveness of the Similar Document Template Matching Algorithm will be evaluated based on several key criteria. The primary criterion is the accuracy of detection, which measures the algorithm's ability to identify similarities in document templates accurately and efficiently. The algorithm should be able to detect instances where fraudulent customers exploit identical templates with minor modifications, distinguishing between suspicious and fraudulent documents. To aid in the interpretation and communication of the algorithm's findings, the detected output should be represented using color-coded flags. Amber flags can be used to indicate suspicious documents that exhibit similarities in template structure or design elements, while red flags should be assigned to identify documents with high potential for fraud. This visual representation will assist investigators in prioritizing their efforts and taking appropriate actions. Input Data Set: The team will have to generate their own dataset using publicly available datasets or archives. This approach ensures that the algorithm is exposed to a wide range of document templates from various providers and customers. The dataset should encompass different document types, such as medical invoices, prescriptions, and lab test reports, reflecting the real-world scenarios the algorithm will encounter during deployment. By using this self-generated dataset, the algorithm can be trained and evaluated under realistic conditions. This approach enables the algorithm to learn patterns and similarities that exist in actual documents, allowing it to accurately detect fraudulent claims and identify suspicious patterns across different providers and customers. Teams working on this problem statement are advised to create their own dataset to build and train their algorithms.","Miscellaneous, Software"

RUTH332,Chatbot to Known Individual Prakriti (Phenotype),"Ayurveda is a natural health care system that emphasizes the treatment of disease in a highly individualized manner as it believes that every individual is unique having a different constitution. It classifies all individuals into different 'Prakruti' types based on the theory of tridosha and each type has a varying degree of predisposition to different diseases. This is independent of racial, ethnic, or geographical considerations. Knowing which particular Prakruti one belongs to, enables them to decide the preference of food which suits them best. By following the rules and regulations regarding food and lifestyle, one can prevent themselves from getting inflicted with various diseases. But, Prakruti assessment is a tedious process that requires the individual to visit the physician followed by a long list of questions in order to reach a conclusion. In order to make this process more convenient, the development of a self- assessment tool with the help of artificial intelligence may prove to be a stepping stone.

RUTH343,Integration of AI for Adaptive Learning for MCQ Selection in PARAKH,"All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has implemented a large-scale program to assess and improve the skills of engineering students in India in AICTE Approved Technical Institutions across the country. In respect of analysis, each of the online assessments (including those testing academic skills and those testing higher order thinking skills) is used for comparing student outcomes. More specifically, each of the Online assessments will be considered as unidimensional, reliable, and good at measuring a range of student ability. The vast majority of the items should also demonstrate psychometric characteristics of students. A Questions bank is already prepared and random selection of questions has been selected for the assessment. However, for the further development PARAKH teams needs a web-based adaptive multiple-choice question (MCQ) testing system that delivers MCQ assessments to users over the internet and adapts the questions based on the user's performance and abilities. A Pre-assessment or initial knowledge assessment can be designed to gauge the user's baseline knowledge; an initial assessment may be conducted. This assessment can consist of a set of MCQs covering different topics or difficulty levels. Based on that result a final assessment can be prepared. The system employs an adaptive algorithm that analyzes the user's responses, time spent on each question and level of difficulty and number of time questions has been asked in the past and also for performance data from the pre-assessment to determine their knowledge level and proficiency in specific areas. The algorithm uses this information to select subsequent questions that appropriately assessment to the students. Based on the adaptive algorithm, the system selects the next set of MCQs from a question bank. The questions chosen may vary in difficulty and content based on the student's performance. For example, if the student answers a question correctly, the platform may present a more challenging question next, while an incorrect answer may result in an easier question. AI based question generation should be integrated in the portal so that no random question is picked from the database and overall performance will be low.","Smart Automation, Software"
